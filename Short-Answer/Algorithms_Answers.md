#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Runtime complexity: O(n), n is increasing linearly with a single step.


b) Runtime complexity: O(n) even though there is a second loop, the second loop is not re-iterating over n, it is only using it as a comparison.


c)Runtime complexity is O(1) because you are returning a constant value and not looping over anything even if you are recursing a single time.
